        <h2>Haiku</h2>
            <p><em>A haiku for my beloved cat</em></p>
            <p>The sweetest kitty
                <br>Or at least when he's with me
                <br>Then I'm right at home
            </p>

        <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite hobbies is video games. I play just about everything, from first person shooters, farming sims, fighting games, and so on. In fact, my dream career is working as a video game developer, which is the main reason for my Computer Science Major. I enjoy development of both the programming and the art and music of a game, so I'm hoping to find a job that allows me to do both. </p>
        <p>Speaking of art, that's another one of my hobbies. I've been doing it since 8th grade, and I think I'm at least pretty decent. I've always done traditional art with a pencil and my sketchbook that I carry around everywhere, but I've recently started to try out doing digital art.</p>
        <p>My third hobby is writing. I'm a big reader and I've always been facinated by books, so it's not surprise that I started writing myself as soon as I had access to something like Google Docs. I think my first pieces were all the way back in elementry school, but I don't think they were very good... Even then, I've kept at it and it's a great medium with which I can express myself.</p>
